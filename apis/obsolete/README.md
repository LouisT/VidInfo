*Old or obsolete APIs!*
-------

The files listed here are __OLD__ / __OBSOLETE__ due to API changes, outages, or other issues out of my control. 
I have no idea when or if they will ever be back, so you can keep an eye on them if you want. 
Create an [issue](https://github.com/LouisT/VidInfo/issues "Title") if they're fixed/back online. 
Just because they're in here does not mean a replacement hasn't been created! See IMDB.
